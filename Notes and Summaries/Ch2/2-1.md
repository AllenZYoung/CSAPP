# 2.1 Information Storage
Most computers use blocks
of eight bits, or bytes, as the smallest addressable unit of memory. <br>
A machinelevel
program views memory as a very large array of bytes, referred to as **virtual
memory**.<br>
Every byte of memory is identified by a unique number, known as its
**address**, and the set of all possible addresses is known as the **virtual address space**.

## 2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation
**A single byte consists of 8 bits**. 
In binary notation, its value ranges from 00000000
to 11111111. When viewed as a decimal integer, its value ranges from 0 to 255.<br>
We write bit patterns as **base-16**, or **hexadecimal** numbers.
Hexadecimal (or simply “hex”) uses digits ‘0’ through ‘9’ along with characters
‘A’ through ‘F’ to represent 16 possible values. In C, numeric constants starting with "0x" or "0X" are interpreted as being in
hexadecimal.  The letters A to F is **not Case-sensitive**.

### Convertions:

- The convertion from Bin to Hex:<br>
First, splitting it into groups of 4 bits each. <br>
Note, however, that if
the total number of bits is not a multiple of 4, you should make the leftmost group
be the one with fewer than 4 bits, effectively padding the number with leading
zeros. <br>
Then you translate each group of 4 bits into the corresponding hexadecimal
digit.<br>
Two examples of convertion:

- The convertion from Dec to Hex:<br>
To convert a decimal number
x to hexadecimal, we can repeatedly divide x by 16, giving a quotient q and a
remainderr, such that x = q*16 + r. We then use the hexadecimal digit representing
r as the least significant digit and generate the remaining digits by repeating
the process on q.<br>
Conversely, to convert a hexadecimal number to decimal, we can multiply
each of the hexadecimal digits by the appropriate power of 16.

## 2.1.2 Words
Every computer has a **word size**, indicating the nominal size of integer and pointer
data. Since a virtual address is encoded by such a word, the most important system
parameter determined by the word size is **the maximum size of the virtual address
space**. That is, for a machine with a w-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range
from 0 to 2^w − 1, giving the program access to at most 2^w bytes.

## 2.1.3 Data Sizes

## 2.1.4 Addressing and Byte Ordering
In virtually all machines, a multi-byte object is stored as a contiguous sequence
of bytes, with the address of the object given by the smallest address of the bytes
used. <br>
The convention—where the least significant byte comes first—is referred to as **little endian**. This convention is followed
by most Intel-compatible machines. <br>The latter convention—where the most significant
byte comes first—is referred to as **big endian**. This convention is followed
by most machines from IBM and Sun Microsystems. <br>

Suppose the variable x of type int and at
address 0x100 has a hexadecimal value of 0x01234567. The ordering of the bytes
within the address range 0x100 through 0x103 depends on the type of machine: (Note that in the word 0x01234567 the high-order byte has hexadecimal value
0x01, while the low-order byte has value 0x67.)

## 2.1.5 Representing Strings
A string in C is encoded by an array of characters terminated by the **null** (having
value 0) character.

## 2.1.6 Representing Code
 Different machine types
use different and incompatible instructions and encodings.<br>
Binary code is seldom portable across
different combinations of machine and operating system.

We can extend the four Boolean operations to also operate on **bit vectors**,
strings of zeros and ones of some fixed length w.
