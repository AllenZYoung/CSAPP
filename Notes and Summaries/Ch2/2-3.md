# 2.3 Interger Arithmetic
Many beginning programmers are surprised to find that adding two positive num-
bers can yield a negative result, and that the comparison
x<y
can yield a different
result than the comparison
x-y<0
. These properties are artifacts of the finite na-
ture of computer arithmetic.


*I suggest that learners do read this part(Interger Arithmetic) carefully. Notes on math operations are always useless, by which I mean you need to delve into the book, and then, understand, remember and grasp it.*

*This [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement) will help.*


## 2.3.1 Unsigned Addition
*Pay attention to overflow.*

## 2.3.2 Two’s-Complement Addition

## 2.3.3 Two’s-Complement Negation
***A useful conclusion: -x = ~x+1***

## 2.3.4 Unsigned Multiplication


## 2.3.5 Two’s-Complement Multiplication


## 2.3.6 Multiplying by Constants
We can use "1U<<k" to compulate "2^k".

## 2.3.7 Dividing by Powers of Two
Dividing by a power of 2 can also be performed
using shift operations, but we use a right shift rather than a left shift. The two dif-
ferent shifts—logical and arithmetic—serve this purpose for unsigned and two’s-
complement numbers, respectively.<br>
An arithmetic right
shift by
k
is the same as division by 2^k
for a nonnegative number.<br>
Unlike multiplication, we cannot express division
by arbitrary constants
K
in terms of division by powers of 2.

## 2.3.8 Final Thoughts on Integer Arithmetic
The “integer” arithmetic performed by computers is really a
form of modular arithmetic.
