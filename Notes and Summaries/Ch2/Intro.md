# Ch.2 Representing and Manipulating Information

Using decimal
notation is natural for ten-fingered humans, but binary values work better when
building machines that store and process information. Two-valued signals can
readily be represented, stored, and transmitted.

In this chapter we consider the three most important  representations of numbers. 

 - **Unsigned**: representing numbers greater
than or equal to 0.
 - **Twoâ€™s-complement**: the most common way to
represent signed integers.
 - **Floating-point**:  a base-two version of scientific notation for
representing real numbers.

Some significant and interesting practice problems will be added to the notes, since the authors said that 
> "The examples will give you an intuition
> behind the ideas, and the practice problems engage you in active learning, helping you put thoughts
> into action. With these as background, you will find it much easier to go back and follow the derivations".

*P.S. Please note that the sentences in note files are not only from the book, I will add my own comprehensions and thoughts.*<br>
*This chapter is a little odd because of a lot of math formulas, but once you understand and remember them, you will find it's awesome.(Yep, I mean "amazing and cool"!)*
