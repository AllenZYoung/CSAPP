*As you know, the calculating on denormalized number is a bit complex, so I suggest tyro to read it several times.*

## 2.4.4 Rounding
**Round-to-even** (also
called round-to-nearest) is the default mode. It attempts to find a closest match.<br>
Round-to-even mode adopts the convention that it rounds the number either upward or downward such that the
least significant digit of the result is even.

## 2.4.5 Floating-Point Operations
*Remember: The lack of associativity in floating-point addition is the most important group property that is lacking.*<br>
This lack of associativity and distributivity is of serious concern to scientific
programmers and to compiler writers. 

## 2.4.6 Floating Point in C
*Omitted*
