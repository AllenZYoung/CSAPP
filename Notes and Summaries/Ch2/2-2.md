## 2.2.1 Integral Data Types

The range is not symmetric, —**the range of negative numbers extends one further than the range of
positive numbers.** *A useful conclusion.*

## 2.2.3 Two’s-Complement Encodings

The most common
computer representation of signed numbers is known as **two’s-complement**
form. This is defined by **interpreting the most significant bit of the word to have
negative weight.**<br>
The most significant bit : x(w−1) is also called **the sign bit.** <br>
Its “weight” is − 2^(w−1), the
negation of its weight in an unsigned representation. When the sign bit is set to
1, the represented value is negative, and when set to 0 the value is nonnegative.
<br><br>
Consider the range of values that can be represented as a w-bit two’scomplement
number.<br>
The least representable value is given by bit vector 10 ... 0
(set the bit with negative weight, but clear all others), having integer value
**TMin(w bits) 
= − 2^(w−1).**<br>
The greatest value is given by bit vector 01 ... 1 (clear the bit
with negative weight, but set all others as "1"), having integer value **TMax(w bits) 
= 2^(w−1) − 1.**

So you can see:

- The two’s-complement range is asymmetric: **|TMin| =
|TMax| + 1**, that is, there is no positive counterpart to TMin. 
- The maximum unsigned value is just over twice the maximum two’s-complement
value: **UMax = 2TMax + 1**.
- −1 has the same bit representation as UMax—a string of all ones.

## 2.2.4 Conversions Between Signed and Unsigned

The effect of casting is to keep the bit values identical
but change how these bits are interpreted.
<br>
This is a general rule for how most C implementations handle conversions
between signed and unsigned numbers with the same word size—the numeric
values might change, but the bit patterns do not. Let us capture this principle
in a more mathematical form.<br>
**UMax** has
the same bit representation in unsigned form as does −1 in two’s-complement
form.

Here we define two functions:<br>
define the function **U2Tw** as U2Tw(x) .
= B2Tw(U2Bw(x)).<br>
the function **T2Uw**, defined as
T2Uw(x) .
= B2Uw(T2Bw(x)), yields the number having the same unsigned representation
as the two’s-complement representation of x.

## 2.2.5 Signed vs. Unsigned in C
In C, generally, most numbers are **signed by default**.
Adding character ‘U’or‘u’ as a suffix creates an unsigned constant.
*But it seems that I have seldom used the unsigned mark 'U'...*
<br>
Consider  the  comparison "-1<0U". Since the second operand is unsigned, the first one is implicitly cast to unsigned. So the expression is equivalent to the comparison 4294967295U < 0U, which of course is false.

## 2.2.6 Expanding the Bit Representation of a Number
To convert an unsigned number to a larger data type, we can simply add leading zeros to the
representation; this operation is known as
**zero extension**
.<br> For converting a two’s-
complement number to a larger data type, the rule is to perform a
**sign extension**
,
adding copies of the most significant bit to the representation.  

## 2.2.7 Truncating Numbers
When truncating a
w
-bit number to a k
-bit number， we drop the high-order
w
−
k
bits.<br>
Truncating a number can alter its value—a form of overflow.<br>
For an unsigned number
x
, the result of truncating
it to
k
bits is equivalent to computing
x
mod 2^k.<br>
*The truncating of signed number is a bit complex...*

## 2.2.8 Advice on Signed vs. Unsigned
As we have seen, the implicit casting of signed to unsigned leads to some non-
intuitive behavior. Nonintuitive features often lead to program bugs,  and ones
involving the nuances of implicit casting can be especially difficult to see. Since the
casting takes place without any clear indication in the code, programmers often
overlook its effects.
*Well, I have copy the whole paragraph here...*
