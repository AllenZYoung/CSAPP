## 2.2.1 Integral Data Types

The range is not symmetric, —**the range of negative numbers extends one further than the range of
positive numbers.**

## 2.2.3 Two’s-Complement Encodings

The most common
computer representation of signed numbers is known as **two’s-complement**
form. This is defined by **interpreting the most significant bit of the word to have
negative weight.**<br>
The most significant bit : x(w−1) is also called **the sign bit.** <br>
Its “weight” is − 2^(w−1), the
negation of its weight in an unsigned representation. When the sign bit is set to
1, the represented value is negative, and when set to 0 the value is nonnegative.
<br><br>
Consider the range of values that can be represented as a w-bit two’scomplement
number.<br>
The least representable value is given by bit vector [10 ... 0]
(set the bit with negative weight, but clear all others), having integer value
**TMin(w bits) 
= − 2^(w−1).**<br>
The greatest value is given by bit vector [01 ... 1] (clear the bit
with negative weight, but set all others as "1"), having integer value **TMax(w bits) 
= 2^(w−1) − 1.**

So you can see:

- The two’s-complement range is asymmetric: **|TMin| =
|TMax| + 1**, that is, there is no positive counterpart to TMin. 
- The maximum unsigned value is just over twice the maximum two’s-complement
value: **UMax = 2TMax + 1**.
- −1 has the same bit representation as UMax—a string of all ones.
