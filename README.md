# About
All notes and summaries are in markdown format, source codes of examples and questions in the book are in C/C++.
All file contents should be in English. I have both the English ver(2nd edition) and the Chinese ver (which is used as the textbook for 
my college course *Introduction to Computer System Structure* in 2015).<br>
I do this project mainly for two purposes. First, I want to summary this "textbook"(as I mentioned above) after my curriculum *Introduction to Computer System Structure*â€™s terminated, I am so interested in this theme(I call it "Hardware Basics for Computer System") that I feel excited on review it in English. Second, I think it's obliged to share knowledge with learners ( as well as coders) who are not so familiar with this aspect.
I write these files in a very casual mind, so my notes won't be so "comprehensive". But it's enough for me.

# Resources
[The Official page](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) for the book of CMU is a good guidance for us, what's more, the open courses about Computer Hardware-Software 
System in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/browse/computer-science) are also accessible amazing resources.
To get answers and solutions for homeworks, there's [an excellent repository](https://github.com/mofaph/csapp)(In Chinese) to help you.
