# About
All notes and summaries are in markdown format, source codes of examples and questions in the book are in C/C++.
All file contents should be in English. I have both the English ver(2nd edition) and the Chinese ver (which is used as the textbook for 
my college course *"Introduction of Computer System Structure"* in 2015).

# Resources
[The Official page](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) for the book of CMU is a good guidance for us, what's more, the open courses about Computer Hardware-Software 
System in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/browse/computer-science) are also accessible amazing resources.
To get answers and solutions for homeworks, there's [an excellent repository](https://github.com/mofaph/csapp) to help you.
